 {\bfseries{\doxylink{class_chiba_chaba}{Chiba\+Chaba}}} is a simple {\bfseries{C++}} project with a small admixture of BP. made from ready-\/made assets. We are using it for training, testing and documentation in Unreal Engine.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Features}{Features}}\label{index_autotoc_md1}

\begin{DoxyItemize}

The project was done in my free time over the course of 3 months. More than {\bfseries{1200}} lines of code with {\bfseries{90\%}} test coverage. The project has {\bfseries{bat}} files for utomatic generation of documentation and tests.

The main part is made in ะก++. Simple AI, derived weapon classes and simple widgets are implemented in BP. There are also some TODO in BP that need to be transferred to ะก++. TODO in ะก++ are mainly related to optimization of spawn enemy. Since this project is aimed at working with testing and documentation, and not creating a full-\/fledged game, these methods may not be finished.

The project has {\bfseries{2 levels}}. 1 for running tests. 2 for demonstrating the gameplay.

In the future, the project can be easily {\bfseries{scaled}}, and also engage in crowd optimization.

{\bfseries{IMPORTANT!}} Paid assets are {\bfseries{not included}} in the repository. But you can freely use the code and logic written in BP
