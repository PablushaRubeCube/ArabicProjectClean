# Project codenamed ChibaChaba. Testing and documentation

**ChibaChaba** is a simple **C++** project with a small admixture of BP. made from ready-made assets.
We are using it for training, testing and documentation in Unreal Engine.

## Features

* Test automation, code coverage
* Documentation generation with doxygen
* Code format with .clang-format

## Info

The project was done in my free time over the course of 3 months. More than **1200** lines of code with **90%** test coverage. The project has **bat** files for utomatic generation of documentation and tests.

The main part is made in ะก++. Simple AI, derived weapon classes and simple widgets are implemented in BP. There are also some TODO in BP that need to be transferred to ะก++. TODO in ะก++ are mainly related to optimization of spawn enemy. Since this project is aimed at working with testing and documentation, and not creating a full-fledged game, these methods may not be finished.

The project has **2 levels**. 1 for running tests. 2 for demonstrating the gameplay.

In the future, the project can be easily **scaled**, and also engage in crowd optimization.

**IMPORTANT!** Paid assets are **not included** in the repository. But you can freely use the code and logic written in BP
